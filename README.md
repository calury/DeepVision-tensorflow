# A deep learning package for computer vision algorithms built on top of TensorFlow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/conan7882/DeepVision-tensorflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/conan7882/DeepVision-tensorflow)

This package is for practicing and reproducing learning-based computer vision algorithms in recent papers.

It is a simplified version of [tensorpack](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack), which is the reference code of this package.
