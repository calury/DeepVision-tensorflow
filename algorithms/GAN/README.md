## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)


TensorFlow implementation of [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434). 

## Usage

You can run this script on CIFAR10, MNIST dataset as well as custom dataset in format of Matlab .mat files and image files.

To train on CIFAR10:
```bash
python DCGAN.py --train --cifar
```
